# EE4-AdminOnlyTicket
Event Espresso 4 - Admin only tickets.

This is a beta version.

We need a way to close registration online.  At this time, we generally created nametags for our events.   
But, we also wanted to be able to sell walk up / door tickets to people without allowing them to be sold online.  
That is the goal of this plugin.

To make a ticket only visible on the admin side, you must first create and save the ticket.  When you expand a ticket, 
there is now a visibility box.  Setting it to Admin Only will set it to admin only.   Public is accessable anywhere.

Have any questions?  Shoot them to chase@datajoe.com and mention EE4-AdminOnlyTicket in the subject line.
